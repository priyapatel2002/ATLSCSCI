        A topic I am really interested in is sustainable clothing!
        I think thrift stores and flea markets are an amazing place to 
        come together and be creative, in addition to helping the environment   
        by reducing clothing waste! I am currently working on building a sustainable
        clothing app for CU Boulder students, and I think this class is really going 
        to help me make it reach its full potential!
        <p></p> 
        Here is an example of a popular sustainable clothing app that helped inspire
        the idea!
